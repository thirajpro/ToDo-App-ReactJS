# Todo App

This Todo app, built with ReactJS, allows users to manage their tasks efficiently. It features task addition, deletion, completion, and task counting functionalities, providing a simple yet effective way to stay organized.

## Project Setup

This project was initialized using **Vite** for a fast and optimized development experience, and **npm** was used as the package manager.

## Main Functionalities

- **Add Todo**: Users can add new tasks to the todo list.
- **Delete Todo**: Users can remove tasks from the todo list.
- **Mark Completed Tasks**: Users can mark tasks as completed.
- **Count Completed Tasks**: The app displays the number of completed tasks.
- **Count All Todos**: The app displays the total number of tasks.

## Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I learned several key React concepts:

1. **React Create Element**
   - Understanding the use of `React.createElement` to create React elements.

2. **JSX**
   - Using JSX syntax to write HTML-like code within JavaScript for a more readable and declarative way to create React elements.

3. **Component**
   - Building reusable UI components to structure the application efficiently.

4. **Parent-Child Relationship**
   - Establishing the hierarchical structure of components where parent components manage the state and pass it down to child components.

5. **Props**
   - Passing data and methods between components using props to create dynamic and interactive UIs.

6. **Conditional Rendering**
   - Implementing logic to render components or elements based on certain conditions.

7. **Props Passing from Parent to Child Components**
   - Ensuring data flow from parent to child components through props to maintain a unidirectional data flow.

8. **Rendering an Array**
   - Mapping over arrays to dynamically create lists of components based on data.

9. **Styling Methods**
   - Applying different styling techniques:
     - **Inline Styling**: Using the `style` attribute directly in components.
     - **CSS Styling**: Linking external CSS files for styling.
     - **CSS Module Styling**: Using CSS modules for scoped and modular styles.
